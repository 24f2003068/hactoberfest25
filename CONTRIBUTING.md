   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hactoberfest25.git
   cd hactoberfest25
   ```

   ```

## üìã Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

#### Python Code
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings for functions and classes
- Include type hints where appropriate

```python
def calculate_fibonacci(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the nth Fibonacci number using dynamic programming.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The position in the Fibonacci sequence
        
    Returns:
        int: The nth Fibonacci number
        
    Time Complexity: O(n)
    Space Complexity: O(1)
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(2, n + 1):
        a, b = b, a + b
    
    return b
```

#### SQL Code
- Use uppercase for SQL keywords
- Proper indentation for complex queries
- Clear table and column aliases

```sql
SELECT 
    u.username,
    COUNT(p.post_id) AS total_posts
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN posts p ON u.user_id = p.user_id
WHERE u.created_date >= '2025-01-01'
GROUP BY u.user_id, u.username
ORDER BY total_posts DESC;
```

### Commit Messages

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
# Good examples:
git commit -m "Fix: Correct logic error in Goldbach's conjecture implementation"
git commit -m "Add: Binary search solution with O(log n) complexity"
git commit -m "Optimize: Improve merge sort performance by 20%"
git commit -m "Docs: Add complexity analysis for heap operations"

# Bad examples:
git commit -m "fix bug"
git commit -m "update code"
git commit -m "changes"
```

### File Organization

- Place files in appropriate week folders
- Use descriptive filenames
- Include problem descriptions as comments at the top of files
- Group related functions together

### Testing Your Changes

Before submitting your contribution:

1. **Test Your Code**
   ```bash
   python your_solution.py
   ```

2. **Check for Syntax Errors**
   ```bash
   python -m py_compile your_solution.py
   ```

3. **Verify Edge Cases**
   - Empty inputs
   - Large inputs
   - Boundary conditions
